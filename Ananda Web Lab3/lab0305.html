                This is a picture of a Cessna 210. The 210 is the flagship single-engine Cessna aircraft. Although the 210 began as a four-place<br>
                aircraft, it soon acquired a third row of seats, stretching it to a six-place plane. The 210 is classified as a high-performance airplane,<br>
                which means its landing gear is retractable and its engine has more than 200 horsepower. In its first model year, which was 1960,<br>
                the 210 was powered by a 260-horsepower fuel-injected six-cylinder engine that displaced 471 cubic inches. The 210 is the fastest <br> 
                singel-engine airplane ever built by Cessna.
